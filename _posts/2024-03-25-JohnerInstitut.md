title: Starting new job in 2024
---
In April 2024, I will be starting a new role as a **usability engineer** for the usability lab at [Johner Institut](https://www.johner-institut.de/) in Frankfurt a. M.
I am very excited to get some more industry experience and to learn more about usability and medical devices!
