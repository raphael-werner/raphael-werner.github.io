Although I left academia a year ago, I have some publication news!
A paper I worked on together with Wim Pouw, Lara S. Burchardt, and Luc Selen has been accepted for publication by the Royal Society B.
We looked into how the **biomechanics of gestures influence the voice**, using a load of multimodal signals including audio, 3D motion tracking via video (for movement), EMG (for muscle activation), RIP (for breathing via torso circumference) and a plate to measure center of pressure (for posture).
We show that **moving the arms** (while manipulating mass) recruits (postural) muscles that **interact with the voice** through respiratory interactions.

While waiting for publication, the [postprint](https://wimpouw.com/files/Pouwetalkinetics.pdf) is already available and so is the [RMarkdown](https://wimpouw.github.io/kineticsvoice/) showing the methods and results.
Wim also made a great [post](https://bsky.app/profile/wimpouw.bsky.social/post/3ll6t7kazbk2j) about it on Bluesky.
